                          Getting Crescent-Vine

==========================================================================

You can download the source code of Crescent-Vine from the Crescent-Vine GitHub
at

  https://github.com/ClassicNick/Crescent-Vine/

Keep in mind that the source code in its raw form may be buggy. If you are
looking for a more polished version of Crescent-Vine, the Crescent-Vine project 
releases builds of Crescent-Vine regularly that you can download from

  https://github.com/ClassicNick/Crescent-Vine/releases
 
Be sure to read the Crescent-Vine release notes for information on known
problems and installation issues with Crescent-Vine.  The release notes 
can be found at the preceding URL along with the releases themselves.


==========================================================================

                         System Requirements

==========================================================================

*Windows

   - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 3.51, NT4, 2000 or XP
   - Intel Pentium class processor (233 MHz or faster recommended)
   - 64 MB RAM
   - 26 MB free hard disk space

* We recommend that Windows 10 users not use 
  Crescent-Vine, and instead use the current version of SeaMonkey or Firefox (Gecko 29+). 
  They are much more secure, compatible with the modern web than 
  Crescent-Vine, and Crescent-Vine is at high risk of not working on Windows 10. IME, 
  Windows 8.1 and Crescent-Vine are fine.


==========================================================================

                      Installation Instructions

==========================================================================

It is strongly recommended that you exit all programs before running the
setup program if you have 64 MB RAM or less. Also, you should temporarily disable virus-detection
software.

Install into a clean (new) directory. Installing on top of previously
released builds may cause problems.

Note: These instructions do not tell you how to build Crescent-Vine.
